
# Hello Gradle

`build.gradle` is saved in the project root. With gradle, the root directory of source files becomes `src/main/java`. Test files should be placed in `src/test/java`. 

run `gradle build` or `gradle compileJava` and check the `build` directory.

This sample defines `class App` in `package app`, so run this classfile as `java app.App` from appropriate directory.
